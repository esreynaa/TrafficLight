# TrafficLight

_Creating a 4-way light intersection and implementing the hardware design through the FPGA Spartan SP601 board_

**_Q2_**: 
+ Design a traffic light system where the north-south street has red, amber, green, and turn left green arrow lights and east-west street has only the red, amber and green lights. Amber, Green, and Green Left light should last 1, 3, and 2 time unit respectively. Left turning traffic will be allowed before the straight traffic.

+ In the implementation on FPGA board use LEDs at E13, C14, C4, and A4 to represent North-South lights of Red, Amber, Green and Green Left Turn lights.
